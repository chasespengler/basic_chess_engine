# Basic Chess Engine
### A project by Chase Spengler

As an avid chess player, I'd often find myself spending hours looking into strategy, researching unique lines, and honing opening and endgame skills.
I had decided I wanted to take my studies further by combining them with another passion of mine and build a chess engine to test out AI models and get 
a better understanding of how professionals utilize and adjust the models they use to improve their strategy, not to mention having all the fun 
associated with the project along the way.

This project is constructed using the pygame module for python. This provided a great way to keep track of the gamestate and easily implement graphics. I look
forward to using some of the built in sprite features and discovering more functionality in the future for an 8bit style rpg I've been designing for some time.

This project is currently a work in progress. It is entirely functional and quite fun, however I will be adding more levels of bots to play against as well as 
reviewing logic and pygame updates for improvements intermittently. Feel free to reach out to contribute a bot to add to the program or just to play a game of chess!
